                70% of the land area on our earth is water, but only 1 percent of water is the only human that can use it, the rest of the water is saline water and icy. Water conservation has become very important today. There is a need to stop the way we abuse water in our daily lives. Many countries of the world are facing an acute shortage of water. In many states of India people have to go far and wide for water.If we use water properly and increase the sources of water, then we can get rid of the water problem. To conserve water, we should collect rainwater, not pollute the rivers and other sources of water, and at the same time use the water properly in our daily lives.</p>
